                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>When Layla arrives at the warehouse in Portland's Eastside Industrial District, it's 12:15 AM, time for her appointment with the management. The windows are blacked out and a flatbed truck lies on its side in the cargo bay, its grille a broken tooth. It's an artifact from before the quake, something the earth didn't swallow up.</p>
                <p><em>You’re a brave girl, Layla.</em></p>
                <p>That's what she tells herself, anyway. Her dad always told her she was brave when she was younger. Back then, she liked climbing trees, buildings, rooftops. It wasn’t just for the view. Up there, no one could tell her what to do.</p>
                <p>Maybe this is just stupid, though, not brave. She’s twenty-seven years old, wearing a gauzy dress her friend Flora made for her, locking her bike to a broken streetlight, looking much too pretty for the vacant lots around her.</p>
                <p>According to her evidence, Catacomb might be a member of the Anonima collective. That's why she’s wearing the dress on a bone-chilling November night and her long dark hair is tied in a French braid while her face is powdered as if she’s going to her own undead wedding. She should’ve worn jeans and a hoodie but she’s a sucker for dressing up when she’s feeling insecure.</p>
                <p>The door scrapes against the buckled concrete and she enters a cavernous space filled with the steady hum of fans and a chorus of printing presses and the deep bass note of a generator beneath her feet. The walls and floor are like paper that’s been crumpled and smoothed over, the brick and masonry crumbling, the concrete deeply cracked. Steel trusses hold up the fissured ceiling three stories above her. The rusted beams, gaunt as a ship’s ribs, saved the warehouse from collapse eighteen months ago, but the building looks like it could fall at any moment.</p>
                <p>A solitary figure smokes on a catwalk above her. He’s wearing a hoodie, jeans, a stocking cap. She waves but he doesn’t wave back.</p>
                <p>Maybe it’s Catacomb.</p>
                <p>She’s seen his silhouette in many strangers lately, usually men sitting alone in coffee shops or bars or waiting at bus stops. With nothing more than a laptop, synth, guitar, and drum machine, he made an album that holds a gun to her head. Rift is the only album Layla has ever given a perfect ten on her website. His voice is so reverb heavy and pitch bent that he sounds dreamy and lovelorn. The beats are manacles crashing on stone. Listening to his private torment is like being in a church after a bombing, the dust rising from the shattered walls, the stained glass still intact, the stars whirling in the sky while everyone else is dead.</p>

                <h2>About Catacomb</h2>
                <p>Layla Mendelson won't give up, even when she should. She's survived endless recessions, her mother's death and an earthquake that leveled Portland, Oregon. Though she's a successful businesswoman and founder of the popular layla.com, she's best known for a series of photos that show her wrapped in plastic bags, pretending to be dead.</p>
                <p>Now she’s determined to find Catacomb, an anonymous musician that's made the only album she's ever given a perfect ten on her website. In her search, she must confront a shadowy "art" collective, discover the mystery of a powder that offers visions of god, and enlist the help of her friends Flora and Nunez to unravel the story of a musician that's become a fugitive.</p>
                <p><em>Catacomb</em> is complete at 99,000 words.</p>
