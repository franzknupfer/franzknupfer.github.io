<h3>The Hook</h3>

<p>Before she became the pop star Penumbra, Allie dreamed of writing songs about apocalyptic medieval artists and the poet William Blake. Before he became Allie’s guitarist and confidante, Jonah was a childhood friend who dreamed of winning her love. Five years after the tragedies that drove them apart make them inseparable again, Jonah must help Allie deal with a porn star doppelganger,  overbearing record executives, and her self-destructive personality.</p>

<p>Can Jonah finally win her heart and help her record the album she always dreamed of making, or will Allie succumb to the crushing weight of her superstar persona?</p>

<p><em>Penumbra</em> is a literary novel of 95,000 words with mainstream appeal.<p>

<h3><strong>Chapter 1</strong></h3>

<p>This is what I remembered when she called me: Allie wearing nothing but a warty troll mask and tennis shoes. She was sixteen years old and ran with her arms out like she was on a tightrope. My breath fogged up in my mask as I ran behind her, trying to keep up. At the time, I was seventeen, virginal, in love with her. Her brother Andrew had put us up to this, one of his usual Halloween dares before he died. We’d been playing quarters with cheap tequila. I thought of her wearing the mask because I didn’t want to think about how beautiful she really was.</p>

<p>“Jonah?” she asked. “Is that you?” Her voice was urgent on the phone.</p>

<p>“It’s me,” I said, trying to cover my surprise. We hadn’t talked in five years.</p>

<p>Back when I knew Allie, she wasn’t Penumbra yet. As a sophomore in high school, she was the lead singer of a girl band called High Priestess. Her dream was to make a concept album about William Blake, but her songs had been hijacked by controlling producers, Swedish hit-makers, computerized algorithms.</p>

<p>“I know I’ve been bad. Will you forgive me?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Forgive you for what?” I was in my roommate’s walk-in closet, my bedroom for the moment, guitar in my arms, phone cradled against my ear. Rob’s Remington was going off in the living room.</p>

<p>“What’s that sound?” she asked, forgetting (conveniently) that we were talking about forgiveness.</p>

<p>“That’s my roommate’s Remington,” I said.</p>

<p>Long silence.</p>

<p>“He collects typewriters,” I added.</p>

<p>“Okay.” There was the roar of an engine on her end, the sound of a bus or perhaps a getaway car. I tried to picture what she looked like at that moment, if she was as beautiful as the cover she’d had on <em>Rolling Stone</em> the year before.</p>

<p>“Forgive you for what?” I was still pressing my fingers against the neck of the guitar, shaping an E-minor chord.</p>

<p>“For <em>everything</em>. There’s nothing like Arkansas to make you penitent.”</p>

<p>“Arkansas?” I wanted to bang the wall and tell Rob to shut up with the typing, except it was his apartment. He was the one with the trust fund.</p>

<p>“I’m in Little Rock. Memphis tomorrow. Think I should go to Graceland?”</p>

<p>“You’re on tour?”</p>

<p>“My dad’s having surgery, so I’m coming home Wednesday. Are you around?”</p>

<p>I didn’t say anything.</p>

<p>“You’re still mad at me,” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s not that,” I said. “I’m not home anymore. Haven’t been for a while.”</p>

<p>“But my mom said—”</p>

<p>“Your mom isn’t a reliable source of information. I just got back from India. Crashing in Williamsburg at the moment.”</p>

<p>“You stalker, you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yeah, sure. Me and everyone else, right?” Back home, I had a poster of Allie in a gray organza dress, her hands clasped in mocking prayer, her fingers a pale, interwoven constellation. I’d had it pinned up in the hallway of my apartment in college, partly for kitsch purposes, partly as a conversation piece. I’d been childhood friends with a superstar.</p>

<p>“You <em>are</em> still mad at me, aren’t you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Not mad, no.” The right word was disappointed, but I didn’t say that. It was bad enough that she’d cratered our friendship. She’d also sold her talent to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sounded hesitant and unsure. “Never mind. I’m sorry I called.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be.”</p>

<p>“How about coffee when I get home?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I’d love to see you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she said dryly. “Keep your pants on.”</p>

<p>The Remington was shitting a hailstorm of bullets in the other room.</p>

<p>“So when will you—”</p>

<p>“I’m being followed,” she said. “I’ll call you when I get back.”</p>

<p>“Followed? What do you mean, followed?” All I could think of was Twitter.</p>

<p>“I’ll call you,” she said. And that was it. Click. End of conversation.</p>

<p>I went out into Rob’s living museum. There was the Hammonia, a metal box that looked more like a paper cutter than a typewriter. Built in Hamburg, 1884. There was the Chicago, built in 1889, and the National, made in Philadelphia. Machines with souls, Rob called them. The typewriters took up nearly every available surface in the room and were polished to a velvety sheen. With the metal radiator in the corner, the piles of manuscripts, and the lumpy couch, an antique in itself, the living room looked like a stenographer’s office in a novel by Henry James, trashed after a drunken weekend with Henry Miller.</p>

<p>“It was that girl I told you about,” I said.</p>

<p>“Penumbra?” Rob asked, not looking up from the typewriter. He had a scruffy beard, black denim pants and a stocking cap. His gray t-shirt had been silk-screened with a fully erect middle finger.</p>

<p>“She has a real name,” I said.</p>

<p>He sprawled across the couch, bemused. “You’re still in love with her and all that. You’ve got this sister complex thing.”</p>

<p>“Except she’s not my sister, and I’m not in love with her,” I said. “Not anymore.” I felt the same way about her as I did about Andrew and my dad. It was as if she’d departed, too.</p>

<p>“Want a glass?” he asked, pointing at an open bottle of pinot noir.</p>

<p>“Not really. Think I’ll go for a walk.”</p>

<p>He nodded sadly. Wine was his way of showing sympathy, and he wanted me to pour my guts out about Allie again, how she and her older brother Andrew had been my best friends. Andrew had died just before Allie moved to New York. The details were all the more sordid because Allie had made it big.</p>

<p>She was Penumbra now, and every other night there was a fuzzy picture of her in the tabloids, usually passed out under a table or smacking paparazzi with a Hermes bag. In the magazines, she favored organza and wool crepe and dresses that made her look as if she’d stepped out of a period piece on the Renaissance. She was never in a bikini or on a beach.</p>

<p>The last time I saw her was a few weeks after Andrew’s funeral. She had her guitar, a messenger bag, a credit card she’d stolen from her mother. She was seventeen and we’d just graduated from high school—me on time and her a year early. Before he died, we were talking about starting a band. I was obsessed with Radiohead, Brazilian guitar music, stripped down electronica. That’s what I wanted our music to sound like, with her voice strobing over it, a sad lunar angel singing of heartbreak. We even came up with a name for us: Fuzz.</p>

<p>As I pressed her against the wall by the ticket counter at the station, my face in her hair, I asked if she blamed me for what had happened to Andrew. She shook her head, too choked up to say anything, but I didn’t believe her. She was mummified in scarves and a stretched fisherman knit sweater. In New York she was staying with the friend of a friend, a girl she’d never met before. I tried to convince her not to go. There was a chord progression playing in my head, something in B-minor. I didn’t have words so I wanted to sing the melody to her, except I couldn’t sing.</p>

<p>She squeezed her eyes shut, as if this suggestion were so exhausting she couldn’t even respond.</p>

<p>“Keep writing songs,” I said. It was a stupid thing to say. She was going to New York to be a musician. “Call me when you get there,” I said. “Let me know you’re safe.”</p>

<p>“All right,” she said, but within a week of leaving, her phone number had been disconnected.</p>

<p>She never did call, until today.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>A few weeks later, we arranged to meet at a coffee shop not far from where I lived. I arrived early and checked myself in the bathroom’s hazy, graffitied mirror. I was presentable at best—dark hair, stubble, skin still bronzed from India. My mother, grandmothers, and aunts all went on about how handsome I was—great news, except I’d never heard it from anyone else. They seemed to be reciprocating for some other quality I lacked—a father, perhaps? Was there a secret auntie rule that said fatherless sons must be praised for their noble looks? But of course they missed him, too.</p>

<p>I found an empty table near the back. Strange music throbbed from the speakers. There was someone on guitar, someone else on static. They held hands with a singing girl, in free fall before pulling the cords on their parachutes. The barista twisted knobs on the espresso machine, DJ Latte at work. All around me, friends I hadn’t made yet peered at laptops and got to know their sandwiches.</p>

<p>I ordered a coffee and checked the newspaper. The headlines blurred as I read them. There’d been an earthquake in China, thousands dead, cities of rubble.</p>

<p>I’d reached the obits by the time she showed up. That was Allie, always late enough to make everyone angry. A gust of wind followed her in, along with a large black man in a gray overcoat. She wore jeans and a black hooded shirt with a guitar embroidered on it, its edges frayed to gossamer. Her long blonde hair was tied in a loose ponytail, her eyes covered with aviator glasses. She was disguised as herself, as Allie. Appearing normal was its own disguise.</p>

<p>She twisted her way between the tables, dancing through a tangled mess of power strips and extension cords, touching the backs of chairs as if she knew them. How many times had we met in coffee shops at home when cappuccino and cookies were the only drugs a kid could get? How many times had we pooled our change with Andrew and sprawled on the striped couches with back issues of <em>Rolling Stone</em>?</p>

<p>If only she was still wearing her troll mask.</p>

<p>I stood and put my arms around her. Her limbs were small and birdlike beneath her shirt. She struggled away, as if I were holding her captive in my tentacles.</p>

<p>“Sorry I’m late,” she said. “I was being followed.” Her voice was bright and nervous, as if she’d drunk too much coffee.</p>

<p>“By that guy?” The man in the gray overcoat watched us from a nearby table.</p>

<p>“That’s my bodyguard.”</p>

<p>“So who’s following you?”</p>

<p>“There’s always someone,” she said, her eyes flickering away.</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence as I appraised her, trying to figure out if she was still my old friend Allie or if she was someone else now. In the afternoon light, her face was painted in soft chiaroscuro. She was very fair-skinned and blonde, her eyes large and perfectly spaced. Her face had that hazy perfection of the moon as seen through clouds, bright and perfectly symmetrical. I had the feeling, as I always had, that if I looked at her through a telescope or magnifying glass she’d appear no closer to me.</p>

<p>“Can I get you something? I’ll get your favorite.” The air thickened, smelled like coffee burning. Her brother was with us even now, and I wondered if she felt it, too.</p>

<p>“What’s my favorite?” she asked, teasing me with a smile. She tilted her head back slightly, looking up at the high, exposed rafters.</p>

<p>“Remind me.”</p>

<p>She was pleased with our banter, as if we’d slipped back into our younger selves. “Today my favorite’s whatever you get me. No raisins. I’ll send you back if there’s raisins.”</p>

<p>I ordered two lattes and a cookie while Allie stared blankly at her phone. Her long hair was gathered in her hood, slightly disheveled, a nest of spun gold. Out on the sidewalk, two men peered through the door into the coffee shop, looking for someone.</p>

<p>“Hope you still like monster cookies,” I said when I returned. She did. Her eyes were like the bright blue sky of Ladakh in the mountains of northern India.</p>

<p>“Do you hate me?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No, but I don’t understand why you never called,” I said. “I mean, I thought we were close.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she said. “You know how I am, kind of antisocial and bad with friends and staying in touch.” This was true. She’d cut off ties with Jenny, Sabrina and all her other friends, too.</p>

<p>“I’m over it now,” I said. “I mean, there were a few years when it really bothered me but I moved on. You’re famous now. Why would you care about your loser friends in Iowa, right?”</p>

<p>“You <em>are</em> still mad,” she said. “I’m sorry. I wish I could explain everything but that would take forever.”</p>

<p>“And why did you call me now? Why after five years?”</p>

<p>“Well, I went home to see my dad,” she said. “He just had triple bypass surgery.”</p>

<p>“Is he okay?” I asked, trying to appear sympathetic.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s fine. Zombies never die, not unless you have special weapons,” she said, waving her hand dismissively. “Anyway, those last few years in Iowa were so bad that I just wanted to forget everything when I left, even the good things.”</p>

<p>I hoped I’d been one of the good things.</p>

<p>“So do you think I’m a sellout?” she asked. She was watching me closely, the way she always had, as if she found my words not just interesting but absolutely essential.</p>

<p>“Not exactly, no,” I lied. I’d expected something different from the three albums she’d made as Penumbra, something more along the lines of <em>Love in the Time of Bosch</em>, the four-song EP she’d made with High Priestess when she was in high school. The EP had been inspired by the music of the twelfth century saint Hildegard von Bingen and it was so eerie that Andrew and I had listened to it endlessly. It was heavy on reverb and had samples of Gregorian chants and spooky sounds ripped from a CD called <em>Haunted Houses for Kids</em>.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice way of putting it,” she said bitterly.</p>

<p>That’s when I realized that like me, she felt the shadow. It was Andrew, but it was something else, too. “Oh, god,” she said, putting her hands over her face. “I’m glad this tour is over. It was awful.”</p>

<p>I searched my mind for a fragment of obscure code, something that might reconnect us and comfort her. I took the damp napkin from under my coffee and wrote Penumbra backwards.</p>

<p>“Arbmunep,” I said, showing her the napkin. “Sounds like an Egyptian goddess, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>At first, she was confused. I had the same delicious feeling as when we were kids and I convinced her that trolls lived in her basement. She managed a smile. “Ah, Hanoj.” She wore what I recognized as her brave look: a deep sigh, her eyelids fluttering. For a moment, the memories sweeping through me passed through her, too, as if a spool of film were threaded between us.</p>

<p>There was another awkward silence.</p>

<p>“You still play guitar?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Sure.” I’d added a few sitar scales and some alternate tunings, but it was still the same music I’d always played. “Didn’t play much in India, though.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t going to India Andrew’s idea?”</p>

<p>“No, actually, it wasn’t.” Her suggestion annoyed me. He’d always claimed the good ideas. “You remember the encyclopedia game?”</p>

<p>“Sure.” She circled her finger in the air. “You make up something and pretend it’s real. That’s why he’s gone.”</p>

<p>“The encyclopedia game?”</p>

<p>“Because he lost touch with reality. I don’t think he ever planned to go anywhere, except to find those, you know—”</p>

<p>“Unnamable Ones,” I finished, shuddering as I said it.</p>

<p>“Let’s not talk about him.” She closed her eyes as if a migraine were coming on. According to her <em>Rolling Stone</em> profile, she still suffered from regular headaches.</p>

<p>“All right.” I didn’t want to talk about him, either. “Anyway, back to the encyclopedia game. One time my finger landed on Ganesha, the elephant god. After that, I wanted to go to India. I never told you guys because I figured you’d think it was stupid.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have said that,” she said, recoiling. “So how was it?”</p>

<p>“Changed my life.” I’d been just another backpacker living on twenty dollars a day, visiting the waterfalls and temples, trying my hand at meditation and sitar. I’d spent a month teaching English to Tibetan monks in McLeod Ganj and I’d learned to swear in a passable Delhi accent. During the spring and fall, I trekked through the Himalaya—the Everest region, the Annapurnas, Ladakh, Sikkim. But I didn’t want to tell her about that. Instead, I made my confession. “I spent three weeks in a cave.”</p>

<p>I’d been back stateside for three months and I hadn’t told anyone else about the cave, even my mother, but I wanted to tell Allie. It wasn’t only the shadow between us but the one inside us that we shared, and the cave was part of that.</p>

<p>“A cave?” She laughed incredulously. “Doing what?”</p>

<p>“It’s not as strange as you might think. There’s a tradition among holy men to meditate in caves. Not that I’m a holy man or anything.”</p>

<p>“You were meditating?” She stifled a laugh.</p>

<p>“What’s so funny?”</p>

<p>“I guess I’m not surprised. You always had that side to you.” She leaned back in her chair.</p>

<p>“What side?”</p>

<p>“Deep,” she said, giving me a flirtatious look. “Mysterious.” She stirred her latte and stuck her tongue in the cup, like a cat drinking from a saucer. “Tell me about your cave, you crazy boy.”</p>

<p>I told her I’d gone to Leh, the capitol of Ladakh, to see the high mountains at the only time of year when the passes weren’t closed by snow. The bus ride from Manali took two days and went over three passes, the highest above seventeen thousand feet. We stopped at a tented camp on the second day of the ride. Over a lunch of chow mein and tea, I talked to an older German man who’d meditated in a cave where a Buddhist saint once lived. A few days later, I took him to dinner at a place in Leh that served momos and fry bread. He sketched a map and described a monastery where I could find a monk who spoke a little English. This monastery was in a village a day’s hike away from the cave.</p>

<p>I planned to try the cave for a day or two, but I ended up staying three weeks. It gave me an exalted feeling, being in that landscape. I meditated in the mornings and in the afternoons I went for long walks and bathed in a glacier-fed stream wreathed by willows. For dinner, I made lentils and rice on a camp stove and had the whole world to myself.</p>

<p>“So why’d you go?” Allie’s eyes were wide now.</p>

<p>I shrugged, though I knew exactly why I’d gone. “I was tired of being scared.”</p>

<p>“Scared of what?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.” I let her confusion linger for a moment before clarifying. “By that, I mean nothingness.” In the evenings, I was a corpse in my sleeping bag. The air was cold outside the tiny core of heat I’d created for myself. Ladakh was a parched landscape of crumbling rock, so barren it obliterated the imagination. “I realized everything wasn’t as important as I thought it was.” She probably thought I sounded like Andrew, except I’d gone to a cave instead of drinking cough syrup, like he had.</p>

<p>She sipped her latte and stared out the window. “It’s good to hear that,” she said. “That everything’s not such a big deal. Sometimes I feel like if I could just exfoliate and scrub really deep down, I’d find a new, shiny person underneath.”</p>

<p>“What’s down there isn’t shiny,” I said. “I wish it was.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that,” she said, rubbing her eyes. “Not now.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“I’ve just been a little wobbly lately,” she said. “Nothing’s quite right.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re working yourself too hard,” I said, crumpling the napkin.</p>

<p>She looked out the window again, suddenly distant. I broke off a piece of cookie. It was a boring bite, no monster left. “I’m so busy these days. Ten hour days, twelve hour days. I don’t even know who I am anymore and I don’t even sleep. I lie in bed and worry, pretty much.”</p>

<p>“You did that before.”</p>

<p>“This is like, squared. This is insomnia extreme. I can’t flip the switch off, my mind’s just racing. What does it matter, really? I’ve been wondering that a lot lately.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been wondering that, too, except all I do is sleep. Still recovering from India, I guess.”</p>

<p>She gave me an appreciative look. “I hope we can be friends again,” she said.</p>

<p>“Of course,” I said, trying to sound as if I believed her. “Everyone wants to be your friend, right?”</p>

<p>“Not really. It’s hard for me to open up with what happened to Andrew and all. Everything I say, it gets around.”</p>

<p>“I feel the same way sometimes. There’s a wall there, a barrier.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I mean. You’re the same. You were like that even before what happened to Andrew, what happened to me—”</p>

<p>“Because of my dad. All the psychology books talk about it. Intimacy issues, trust issues. When you lose someone that young—”</p>

<p>“Right, and that stuff keeps coming up. I used to think there could be resolution. My therapist talks about closure and all that, but it haunts you, that’s part of the package. I’m sure I would’ve been a different person otherwise. I wouldn’t have been Penumbra.” Her phone rang. She checked the caller but didn’t answer. “God, I wasn’t planning on talking like this. Do I look like I’m going to pieces?”</p>

<p>“You look fine to me.”</p>

<p>She smiled, glanced at Marcus. He tapped his wrist, indicating the time. “I’ve got to go.”</p>

<p>“What would he do if I put my hands around your neck and pretended to strangle you?” It was the squid in me, hoping for another chance at a squeeze. She giggled as I put my arms around her. Now her hair had the woodsy smell of coffee beans. I wanted to bite the delicate stalk of her neck, hauling her off like a kitten.</p>

<p>“I’ll call you, okay?” she said, her voice hesitant.</p>

<p>“Sure.” I forced a smile. “Let’s stay in better touch this time.” I tried to sound casual, as if I didn’t care much either way.</p>

<p>She put on her sunglasses and ducked her head down. It was a tabloid pose, an attempt at being anonymous. She pirouetted between the tables and a hipster looked up, trying to place her, then returned to his sandwich.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>There was a strange golden light coming from above when I went outside, but it was only those few reddish minutes at dusk turning me liquid and washing me away. All the brownstones were saturated with memory and longing, though I didn’t remember them. I was a sickly Proust trying to recall details from my past. It was happy hour, and I considered checking in on Ryan, who worked at a bar down the street, but I wanted to be alone.</p>

<p>When Allie asked if she was a sellout, I’d wanted to reply with another question: “What about Dahlia?” The floor at Dahlia was sticky with beer and the urinal was a long trough like a bathtub. In the afternoons, there were sad clusters of old-timers playing darts. At night, there were indie bands from all over. High Priestess had played a show there, an afternoon alcohol-free event that pitted bands from Central High against ones from East. They’d finished second to the Flesh Nuggets.</p>

<p>As a senior in high school, I’d written a preview for High Priestess’ show in the paper:</p>

<p>“Looking for a place to worship? Try Dahlia’s this Sunday afternoon, when High Priestess play at Battle of the High School Bands. When asked how they became the best band at Central, Allison Hayes, lead singer and guitarist, said, ‘We sacrifice humans and drink their blood.’ ‘We play until our fingers bleed,’ added drummer Jenny Patrick, who lay sprawled on the lumpy couch in the Hayes’ family basement, where they often practice. Hayes and Patrick are two parts of this talented trio, the third being keyboardist Sabrina Schumacher. It’s hard to miss them as they drift through the halls of Central, looking like high priestesses in their white gowns. Hayes was suspended for a day in October for wearing a veil to school and refusing to take it off. ‘I’m making a statement about what it means to be a High Priestess,’ Hayes said. ‘It’s not about how I look, it’s about totally erasing the self for the music…’” And so on. Terrible stuff.</p>

<p>When she was a girl, Allie had drawn elfin women with Celtic crowns, their faces plain and unbroken as snowfields, their hair made of intricately woven vines, their bodies shrouded in translucent white gowns. She’d told me stories of Beltain rituals she’d read about in books of witches and paganism. Hadn’t Andrew yelled “orgies!” and thrown up his hands, making us laugh? That memory made me sad now. As I walked home, Allie whispered in my ears, her tone mocking and seductive. It wasn’t <em>Love in the Time of Bosch</em> stuck on repeat in my head, but “Death Wish,” a song from her newest album. It was one of the better tracks on <em>Nearly Lost</em>, filled with echoing pianos and a downtempo beat.</p>

<p><em>You’ve got a death wish, just feeling kind of blue.</em></p>

<p><em>You’ve got a death wish, be careful what you do…</em></p>

<p>I went to one of her shows a few years back, at a convention center, and sat in the nosebleed seats, just to see what it was like. I was at the show with Sabrina, Allie’s old band mate, the only friend from my teenage years that I stayed in touch with in college. We even had a little thing for a while.</p>

<p>I tried to call Allie before the show, but she had so many handlers it was impossible to reach her. She was in a different realm now, one where people like me weren’t admitted.</p>

<p>The show was crazy. I’d never been around so much bubbling young estrogen in my life. It made me dizzy, all those teens with their high-pitched laughter and giddy voices, texting and taking pictures of each other, caroming through the crowd and chewing bubble gum, some wearing the skankiest little shorts I’d ever seen on fourteen-year olds, some wearing black and hot pink and shades of purple, some with bracelets that glowed in the dark. The place smelled of cheap perfume and ovulation. A crowd of girls glanced at me and giggled, but I ignored them.</p>

<p>Sabrina laughed at them and the teens furiously examined their phones. “Those teenyboppers totally want to rape you,” she said. She wore an earth-toned skirt, a blue conductor’s cap and a tank top silk-screened with a smoking gun. There was a tattoo of a goddess wrapped in vines on her bare shoulder. Once she’d dyed her hair strawberry red but in college it was its natural color, a faded auburn like fallen autumn leaves.</p>

<p>“Me?” I scoffed.</p>

<p>“Don’t play that humble bullshit. You know you’ve got that tall, dark thing going.”</p>

<p>“You look pretty nice yourself.”</p>

<p>(Our thing started that night. It didn’t last long—none of my relationships did.)</p>

<p>When the lights went down, a hush filled the convention center while cell phones and bracelets lit the dark. Then sparks exploded from the stage in time with the heavy backbeat of “Power Trippin’.” Penumbra strutted out with a leash in her hand. A muscular black man dressed as a robot was on the other end of the leash. He rubbed against her as the stage erupted in light. Six couples dressed as robots began to rub against each other, the men lifting their partners in the air, the women rocking their heads back and forth, the men squatting down as the women pranced away. Most of the men were black, the women white, the backing band white except for the black bassist, and the crowd was a mass of seething white girls pressed against the metal banister by the stage like the crest of a giant wave thrashing against a cliff. Penumbra marched up the runway wearing silver fishnets with a black organza gown.</p>

<p>“<em>You think you’re power trippin,’ but you better think—again!</em>” The dancers shook their heads in unison. “<em>You think you’re really sweet, but you’re livin’ in sin…</em>” The women rocked their hips slowly and steadily. “<em>You think you’re playin’ the field, but guess where I been? Hangin’ out in your apartment with your best friend!</em>” The men moved to new partners as the audience pressed forward with dry-humping jubilation.</p>

<p>The grand finale of the show was the multiplatinum hit from Penumbra’s first album, “Want Me.”</p>

<p><em>You don’t even like me but you want me...</em></p>

<p><em>I don’t even like you but I want you…</em></p>

<p>It had been one of the year’s pop anthems for teen girls, frat boy keggers and gay clubs. Down in the sea of girls on the floor below us, a contingent of gay men wearing button-up vests and derbies wriggled their hips while waving invisible lassos in the air.</p>

<p>The song captured something of how we felt about others and ourselves. Thousands of girls sang along. My eyes were flayed, my ears blown open as if I were strapped to the fuselage of a jumbo jet. Penumbra toyed with us as if we were pinned between her legs. She could’ve led an army of teens in battle against their controlling parents, deceitful boyfriends and annoying teachers, against roaming charges, embarrassing periods and baby fat, all in the name of the darkness and misery that creeps into people’s heads when the mall and the radio and TV aren’t enough. So why wasn’t she leading that army according to her ideals? Why had one of her songs become the theme music for feminine body spray?</p>

<p>I would’ve preferred if she’d gone on the coffee shop circuit and sung songs about fairy tales, a wispy fairy tale herself. But how do you tell a twenty-two year old girl worth eight figures that being a starving artist is better? It was her job. Meanwhile, I lived in a closet and many of my old college friends were in grad school or living in their parents’ basements, trying to weather the recession.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>I didn’t expect her to call again, but she did, just a few days after we met for coffee. “Guess who’s the stalker now?” she joked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I answered. “You?”</p>

<p>“Nope,” she said. “Still you.”</p>

<p>“You being followed?”</p>

<p>“Always,” she said. “I hired a detective to keep an eye on her.”</p>

<p>“Who’s following you?” I asked. For some reason, I’d assumed her stalker was a sad-faced man with sweaty hands. Not me, though.</p>

<p>“Penumbra mostly,” she said.</p>

<p>I was quiet. Even Rob’s Remington was silent.</p>

<p>“You know, the <em>other</em> one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yeah, her,” I said.</p>

<p>“You know her, don’t you?” she asked, her voice mischievous.</p>

<p>“I know <em>of</em> her.”</p>

<p>“Mm-hmm,” she said. “I see.”</p>

<p>I didn’t like her insinuation, so I was quiet again. The other Penumbra was in the porn business. For fifteen minutes on occasional lonely nights, I watched clips of her on my laptop. It was like squeezing blackheads or having a case of traveler’s diarrhea—something I’d rather not share with others.</p>

<p>“You want to get a drink? I’m at The Golden Buddha.”</p>

<p>“Sure.” The bar sounded vaguely familiar; it was one of those nightspots where everyone goes but nobody gets in. She named a Tribeca address and told me to meet her in an hour. I showered and brushed Rob’s wine off my teeth, trying to make myself presentable. I went through my limited clothing options, which hung above me while I slept. T-shirt or button down, jeans or slacks? I was terribly insignificant, but insignificance had its own allure. I could be James Dean coolly running my personality off a cliff. “Reality check, Jonah,” I told my reflection. “Remember the cave.” Saying that made me feel better. I dressed as nicely as I could, which wasn’t saying much: best jeans I had, Pendleton wool button-up, Italian shoes my mom gave me for my birthday. I should’ve moved to Portland, not New York.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” Rob asked. His Remington was shooting blanks tonight.</p>

<p>“Out for a bit.” There was an awkward silence while he waited for an invitation.</p>

<p>“I’m in the middle of a story, anyway,” he said finally. “I’d better stay focused.” He’d opened a second bottle of wine and poured himself a glass, trying to hide his disappointment.</p>

<p>I took the subway to Canal Street and walked the rest of the way. A line of people snaked along a velvet rope, all of them better dressed than me. The bouncer looked like a sumo wrestler in a fat suit. His head was shaved, his Confucian beard strung up in knots. I called Allie to let her know I’d arrived. A few minutes later, Marcus came to the door and the bouncer gave me a curt nod. I tried to pretend I did this kind of thing every day, though I’d never been inside a bar with a velvet rope before. The very idea of a velvet rope annoyed me. Why wait outside for drinks?</p>

<p>I was sufficiently awed when I entered the space. In the center of the room, there was a gold Buddha on a backlit fountain, his fingers reaching down in the “Touching the Earth” pose. Veins of water ran through the glass beneath my feet, snaking up the walls and cycling back into miniature waterfalls. A young man playing a harmonium sang with a hypnotic voice, his eyes hooded above a bearded face.</p>

<p>Marcus waved me over and parted a curtain. Behind the curtain was a booth where Allie sat with a tall, gauntly handsome man on a leather couch. She looked at me with unfocused eyes, her hands curled into loose fists. “Jonah! You’re here!” She struggled to sit upright. She wore a black strapless dress cut above the knee, which she smoothed like a skittish pet.</p>

<p>“Have a seat,” the man said. He was vigilant, full of coiled energy. I had the feeling I was supposed to kneel down and call them King and Queen, which annoyed me immensely. When I shook his hand, I tried to match his chummy death grip. “Name’s John Wylde,” he said. He turned to Allie. “He’s not a journalist, is he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he’s a writer.” Allie’s lovely smile said she wasn’t to be trusted, but I already knew that. At least she hadn’t called me a musician.</p>

<p>“He’ll write awful things about us, then,” Wylde said.</p>

<p>“He’ll write wonderful things about us. Won’t you, Jonah?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said. “I won’t write anything at all.”</p>

<p>“Allison says you live in Williamsburg.”</p>

<p>“In a closet,” Allie said, flinging her arms up and laughing.</p>

<p>“It’s not even a nice closet.” I tried to sound nonchalant even though I felt like an ugly troll.</p>

<p>“Drinks are on us,” Wylde said, because I’d punched my ticket to poverty. The menu was mostly infusions; it was possible to get drunk here and still get your vitamins. A few were made with tea from Assam or Darjeeling, and I remembered visiting those places as if I’d been happy then. I had to remind myself that I’d been a little confused and out of place, just as I was now. Someday, when I remembered having drinks in a golden temple with Penumbra and Wylde, I might see myself with the false glow of nostalgia, as if I’d had it made.</p>

<p>“That story in the newspaper,” Wylde said. “It wasn’t true. They never are.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t concern me,” I said, trying to figure out which story he meant. There were rumors he’d nearly beaten a paparazzi to death with a golf club.<p>

<p>“It’s a vast media conspiracy,” Wylde said, watching me closely.</p>

<p>“Could be,” I said, not wanting to commit one way or another.</p>

<p>“I don’t like childhood friends,” he said. “They always show up when you least expect.”</p>

<p>“She was the one that called,” I said.</p>

<p>Allie whispered in his ear and his eyes had a faraway look, like he was trying to catch the scores on a distant TV.</p>

<p>“You never know,” he said as he activated his phone and made a call. “Bring the car around.” He hung up. “I wish I could stay, but I have another engagement.” He shook my hand. “Enjoy your evening. You <em>have</em> met Marcus, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>Marcus parted the curtain and lifted a finger in acknowledgement.</p>

<p>“What was all that about?” I asked after Wylde had left.</p>

<p>“He owns my label. Very hands on, isn’t he?” She gave me an enigmatic smile. “He wanted to meet you.”</p>

<p>“Me?” I pointed at myself in amazement.</p>

<p>“I told him about you.”</p>

<p>“What did you tell him?”</p>

<p>“Just that you’re one of those writer-types and that you used to be my number one fan. He’s not really into writers, plus I’m in his high-risk group or something.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t tell him about Fuzz and all that, did you?”</p>

<p>“Hell, no. If he knew you played music, your drink would be—” She put a finger across her neck. “Rigged.”</p>

<p>“Rigged?” I laughed. “You rig elections, not drinks.”</p>

<p>“Same thing,” she said. “Anyway, it’s kind of sweet. He’s like the dad I never had.”</p>

<p>“And you like that?”</p>

<p>“I hate it. Someone has to hold my hand every time I cross the fucking street.”</p>

<p>“That’s rough. I don’t envy you.”</p>

<p>She laughed. “Sure you do. You live in a closet in Williamsburg.”</p>

<p>We sat in silence, listening as the fakir on stage moaned secrets in our ears. The longing in his voice reminded me not just of his existence but the briefness of my own. Allie suggested shots of espresso liquor and ordered two, along with a plate of curried prawns. “It wakes you up and gets you drunk at the same time,” she informed me, as if sharing an inside secret about getting by in the city.</p>

<p>I squeezed into the seat beside her and she gave me a dazed smile. The curtains were parted just enough to see the bar. “What do you think of that guy’s hair?” I asked, nodding towards an older man.</p>

<p>“It’s awful. I’m surprised they let him in. He’s wearing a Brioni, though.”</p>

<p>“You know that stuff?” I brushed up against her arm, happy to be with her.</p>

<p>“What’s the point of a comb-over? It never works.”</p>

<p>“You think it’s possible that in the future, we won’t have hair anymore?” I asked. “That maybe in a thousand years, we’ll have evolved to the point where we’re hairless?”</p>

<p>“There won’t be anyone left in a thousand years.”</p>

<p>Our food and drinks arrived and I speared a prawn with a toothpick. I hadn’t eaten this well since arriving in the city.</p>

<p>“You really think so?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There may be a few mutants trying to survive, but I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“Will there still be trees?”</p>

<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p>“When I think we’ll all be gone because we fucked up the planet, it makes me feel better if I imagine the world covered in trees again. Eventually, there’d be as many trees as there were a thousand years ago. What do you think?”</p>

<p>Allie sighed and put her head against my shoulder. “I’ve been so tired lately. All I ever do is work. What do you think I was doing with Wylde? Working! Where do you think he went? To work!”</p>

<p>“You think talking to me is work?”</p>

<p>“I did three interviews today. They all asked the same questions.”</p>

<p>“They asked if people will go bald in a thousand years?”</p>

<p>“Pretty much.”</p>

<p>“What did you tell them?” I asked, enjoying our little game.</p>

<p>“That there will be no more people in a thousand years. That none of this will matter or ever did matter. Plus my favorite food is lasagna.”</p>

<p>“You used to like hot dogs, right? You heated them in the microwave and covered them with sliced pickles and ketchup.”</p>

<p>She elbowed me. “When I was ten. Are you going to write about what a loser I used to be?”</p>

<p>“I’ll write only good things, like you said.”</p>

<p>“It’s the bad things that sell records, so the good things are really the bad things, or maybe it’s the other way around.”</p>

<p>She excused herself and went to the bathroom. I speared the last of the prawns as a girl in a flapper’s dress made of feathers danced around The Buddha.</p>

<p>When Allie returned, she looked freshened up, though it was after midnight. Suddenly I was tired. I was sick of being in a closet. It had taken just a few minutes with Wylde to see how his world worked and where I belonged in it.</p>

<p>A waiter came with two more shots of espresso liquor. Apparently survival in the city depended not on shots but salvos.</p>

<p>“Drink with me,” Allie said.</p>

<p>“To what?”</p>

<p>“You’re here. You have your own closet now.”</p>

<p>We tipped back our glasses. “I might as well enjoy it. I won’t be here long.”</p>

<p>“Why?” She slammed down her glass with an enthusiasm reserved for the drunk and highly caffeinated.</p>

<p>I thought of Rob’s airless closet, which smelled like old takeout no matter how much I cleaned. “It’s not working out.”</p>

<p>Her smile disappeared. “You can’t leave.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You just can’t.”</p>

<p>“Whatever.” I didn’t feel like arguing.</p>

<p>Soon she got cross-eyed drunk, though I tried to cut her off. She reminisced about TV shows we’d watched as kids. We’d stayed up late, watching the scrambled channels, trying to pick out a breast or butt from the disorienting bars. “Slushees,” she shouted happily. “Would you stay if we start a slushee bar?” I grinned through the haze of liquor, thinking back to those TV shows I’d hated. As I watched the past through dark, scrambled bands, I remembered Andrew’s domineering side, Allie’s mood swings. Allie talked of our teen years as if they were the only sweetness she’d ever known. “Losers! We were such big losers.”</p>

<p>“I got you started on guitar.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, right, you knew like five chords back then.”</p>

<p>“I tried to sing with you.”</p>

<p>“You sounded like a horse’s ass, but you were so <em>sincere</em>.” She closed her eyes, crooning the word. When she shifted on the couch, I noticed her underwear was a lacy black thing. A few minutes later, she curled on her throne and fell asleep. I gave her a gentle nudge but she was out, so I finished my drink and then hers. This is how you get mono, a college roommate had told me once. At parties, I’d continued to take my chances and downed half-finished drinks, not wanting them to go to waste.</p>

<p>“I think Allie’s done for the night,” I said to Marcus.</p>

<p>He looked at her without surprise. “Why don’t you sit with her a bit, have some coffee?”</p>

<p>“She do this often?”</p>

<p>“That’s not for me to say.”</p>

<p>Instead of ordering coffee, I got a double of thirty-year scotch and more prawns. It was going on her expense account anyway. Allie’s knees were drawn to her chest and she looked as if she were enjoying a peaceful prenatal sleep. In the video for “Death Wish,” she’d twisted herself into a ball, wearing just underwear and a tank top as she screamed about the darkness of young love.</p>

<p>At closing time, Marcus came in and woke Allie. We helped her outside while she murmured in our ears, her voice full of sweet insinuation. Even half-asleep she wanted attention and admiration. Perhaps even in deep sleep she remained aware of the adoring eyes around her, clustered like patterns in a honeycomb.</p>

<p>A Towncar waited by the curb. Allie went into the backseat while Marcus sat in front with the driver. I was left to wait for the train to Williamsburg. Later, Allie told me she’d slept better than she had in months. It was because of me, she said, as if I should be flattered that I wasn’t just her friend but her sedative.</p>
